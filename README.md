# -The Calculator 
This code is for a simple calculator application called calc_app.py that performs and
records simple calculations.
The calculator application should allow users to perform a calculation or print
previous calculations stored in a file called equations.txt.
If a user chooses to perform a calculation, the app should accept two
numbers and an operation ( +, -, *, or /) as inputs from the user. The
answer should be displayed for the user, and the equation and answer
should be recorded in equations.txt (e.g., 21 + 3 = 24).
If a user chooses to print previous equations from equations.txt, display
all previous equations.
